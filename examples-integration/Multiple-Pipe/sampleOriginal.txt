Engineering has existed since ancient times as humans devised fundamental inventions such as the wedge, 
lever, wheel, and pulley.
Each of these inventions is essentially consistent with the modern definition of engineering.
The term engineering deriving from the word engineer, which itself dates back to 1300,
When an engine'er (literally, one who operates an engine) originally referred to "a constructor of military engines."[4] In this context, 
now obsolete, an "engine" referred to a military machine, i.e., a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a catapult). 
Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, e.g., the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
The word "engine" itself is of even older origin, 
ultimately deriving from the Latin ingenium (c. 1250), 
meaning "innate quality, 
especially mental power,
 hence a clever invention."[5]
