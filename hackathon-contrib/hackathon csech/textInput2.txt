1 Roses are red,
2 Violets are blue,
3 All of my base,
4 Are belong to you.
5 Roses are red,
6 Violets are blue,
7 Some poems rhyme
8 But this one doesn't.
9 Roses are red,
10 Violets are blue,
11 Make me a sandwich,
12 Or I will kill you.
13 Roses are grey,
14 Violets are grey,
15 I'm color blind.
